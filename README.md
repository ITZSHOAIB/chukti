# Chukti (In Development...)

**Chukti** is a powerful library designed to simplify the process of testing smart contracts using Cucumber's human-readable Gherkin syntax. With Chukti, you can write end-to-end tests for your smart contracts in a language that everyone on your team can understand, from developers to non-technical stakeholders.

## Features

- `Human-Readable Tests`: Write tests in plain English using Gherkin syntax.
- `Flexible Environment`: The initialized project can be later expaned with any other tool.
- `Reusable Step Definitions`: Predefined step definitions for common smart contract operations.
- `Automated Setup`: Quickly initialize new projects with a single command.
- `Extensible`: Easily add custom step definitions to suit your project's needs and scale your project further.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install Chukti globally, run

```bash
npm install -g chukti
```

### Initializing a New Project

Create a new project with Chukti and Cucumber:

```bash
chukti init
```

or

```bash
npx chukti init
```

This command sets up a new project with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.

### Writing Tests

Chukti allows you to write tests in Gherkin syntax. Here's an example:

```feature
Feature: Counter Contract
    Scenario: Increment the counter
        Given a deployed "Counter" contract
        When I call the "increment" function
        Then the "number" variable should be "1"
```

### Running Tests

To run your Cucumber tests, use the following command:

```bash
chukti test
```

## Example Project

Check out the sample-projects/anvil-cucumber directory for a complete example project. It includes a sample contract (Counter.sol), feature files, and step definitions.
