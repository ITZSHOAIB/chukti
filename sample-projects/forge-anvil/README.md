# Sample Chukti Project

This project demonstrates a basic Chukti use case. It comes with a sample contract Counter.sol, a test for that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
chukti --help
chukti test
```

## Test Reports

After running the tests, you can check out the generated test reports in the [`test-reports`] folder.
